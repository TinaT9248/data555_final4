# Gene Network and Brain Cortex Expression Dashboard

This interactive dashboard visualizes gene expression levels in the brain cortex and gene-gene interaction networks using KEGG pathway information. It is designed to help users explore biological patterns and identify key genes related to neurological pathways.

## Dashboard Contents

- **Brain Cortex Gene Expression**: A bar chart and sortable table using GTEx Brain Cortex tissue data.
- **KEGG Pathway Network (hsa04610)**: A force-directed interactive graph showing gene relationships from the Complement and Coagulation Cascades pathway.

## Files Included

- `hw4_dashboard.Rmd`: RMarkdown file used to generate the dashboard.
- `hw4_dashboard.html`: Rendered HTML version of the dashboard.

Note: Source data files used to build the dashboard are not included. Data were derived from publicly available resources: [GTEx Portal](https://gtexportal.org/) and [KEGG Database](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/).

## Real-World Relevance

This dashboard helps researchers and clinicians explore gene activity and relationships in brain tissue. Insights gained from these interactive tools may support neurological disease research and inform therapeutic target discovery.
